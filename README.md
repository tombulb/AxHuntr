A CRUD web app based around Ruby, Sinatra and Postgres SQL to host reviews of guitars written by guitarists. 
Users can post their own reviews and read reviews posted by other users.

tech used:

Written in Ruby, HTML and CSS using Sinatra Framework and PostgreSQL database management system.

Bcrypt - binding for the OpenBSD bcrypt() password hashing algorithm, allowing you to easily store a secure hash of your users' passwords.

Cloudinary - cloud based image and video management services

unsolved problems:

The app is functional as is, but needs more interesting features such as:

  - Make use of Cloudinary to format images better as well as include widgets for when users are uploading photos and allow the upload of video files.
  - Search function allowing users to browse for brand or model from the homepage
  - A lot of little features and further website formatting, for eg. add a link to the post authors profile from a post and reformat things like the
    log in fail messages so they actually look like an error
